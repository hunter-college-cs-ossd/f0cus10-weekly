I often alternate between being kind and understanding and being overly supercillious. It really depends on which days you catch me. Too much detail for an academic blog? Definitely. But I justify this in my mind by saying that this is in preparation for my personal opinion + technical blog. 

#### Disclaimer

I am *very* opinionated sometimes. Sometimes I play devil's advocate, sometimes mediator. Me being an __introverted__, __socially awkward__ and __egotistical__ computer science student does not help with the entire discourse. Sometimes I wonder if it's lack of social discipline or my rebelliousness that is to blame. Perhaps it's the *perpetual* cycle of one feeding of the other. So, if you do decide to listen to what I have to say, take it with a grain of salt and understand that I am only human and __you should always think for yourself__.
