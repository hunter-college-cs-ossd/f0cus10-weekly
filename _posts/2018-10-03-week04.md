### Collaborative Editing

This particular task has been exhausting. I quickly realized how terrible I am when it comes to following instructions. Will this jeopardize my fervent wish to contribute to open source in the future? *Je ne sais pas*. Regardless, there is no going back now. 

#### My contributions

I made my allotted changes to [Francis] and [Jimmyzs] repositories. I sifted through all the grammar and tried my best to fix certain sentence structures. My experience as a grammar elitist may have come in handy during this but I tried my best to be cordial when making suggestions. However, my untrained eyes have, undoubtedly, skipped an error here and there. I made multiple commits and submitted a pull request to each of their repositories after adding them and pushing them on to **my fork**.
