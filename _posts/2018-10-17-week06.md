### Redemption
In continuation from the 5th week's [blog], this is a chance to re-acquaint myself with Git workflow -- more advanced than last time. And this time, I shall not fail. Or will I? We shall see. 

#### The dreaded task
The task is simple.
- Fork your teammate's repo
- Make changes and push it
- When they do the same, merge them and resolve any conflicts.

At first glance, it seems overtly simple. However, keep in mind that I am a complete beginner in all this and I have never done something as strenuous as *resolving merge conflicts*. I mean, how do you even decide which changes to keep? What about indentation?

#### Being Pushy
After many hours of procrastination, I decided to ask a teammate on how to proceed with the assignment in a text message. He warned me about the merge conflicts and the general style of the code. Additionally, he mentioned a **bug** resulting from a typo in the original [repository]. 

I decided that it would be best to fork everyone's repository first and pull the changes made to my repository afterwards. "This would be easier to do, if the previous assignment is any indication", I thought to myself. So, in true fashion, I forked [Chocolate-Spaghet], [johncgenere] and [gutierrezjdr]'s repositories. Then I added a corny oddity in the English language from a [list], per the instruction.
