###Assignment 1

The walkthrough for using the iD editor on OpenStreetMap was very intuitive; simple click-and-drag actions that allow for powerful edits.

The idea of my post office popped into my head. I don't know why, but perhaps it has something to do with me worrying about my
missing package. Anyhow, I quickly noticed that the address is not labelled as a Post office on OpenStreetMap. So, I simply went ahead and made the changes. I didn't have to do any extra area labelling.

Since I was already in the mood to making *landmark* changes, I decided to see if my banks were labelled. Unfortunately, my bank was already on the map. So I proceeded to look over the changes on a nearby bank. I quickly noticed that this one was not labelled, either. So, again I pulled out my nifty and powerful tools and made my mark upon the world.

Next, I noticed that the parking lot near the bank was not marked. So, I went ahead and marked it and labelled it.

It really helped that I have local knowledge of the places and that I was willing to provide evidence for the changes.
