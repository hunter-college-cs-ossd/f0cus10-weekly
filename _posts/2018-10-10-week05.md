### The Ticket to Open Source
Keeping up with the theme, our [assignment] this week was to read up more about open source software and understand better how to approach a project. Topics included beginner-friendly contributions, contributing through providing documentation, support, and maintenance, and a deeper dive into bug-tracking systems. Although I skimmed over the others, I chose to get a better understanding of bug trackers (or *ticket trackers*, as the author chooses to call it) through Karl Fogel's book.

#### Tickets indicate participation
A healthy amount of ticket and ticket-related interaction indicates that the project's maintainers are active in keeping track of underlying bugs and working to get them resolved. It allows a visitor to get an insight about how *alive* the project is and quickly determine whether it is worth their time and effort. What is more important, from my understanding of the reading, is not following the classic ticket life cycle, but handling exceptions to it.

Although tickets are insightful and provide valuable information to developers, such tickets grow increasingly rare as the project begins to gain popularity. There can be a significant portion of tickets that are **duplicate** or **invalid**. It is upon the maintainers, then, to answer all these tickets in an efficient but encouraging and compassionate way to sustain the link and appreciate the effort the users put in despite its invalidity.
