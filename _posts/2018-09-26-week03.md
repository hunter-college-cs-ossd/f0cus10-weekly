### Feet wetting in Git Workflow

Git work flow is one of the most important aspects of contributing to open source. Many a times I have wanted to contribute to a repository that I believe could use some of my skills -- which isn't many to begin with -- but had to step back since I hadn't the foggiest on how to open pull requests and handle forks.

This week's endeavors focused on *exactly* that. I made a fork of an instructor provided [repository] and `clone`d it into my local machine. Interestingly enough, I also set an `upstream` by `git remote add` which I had no knowledge of previously. I reckon it is used to keep track of the changes other users would make to the original *canonical* repository. Being the heretic I am, I added `f0cus10.cpp` on [my fork] of the repository and opened a [pull request] to the canonical one.

Now, I wait.
